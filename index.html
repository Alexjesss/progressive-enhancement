    <h4>The story</h4>

    <blockquote>

        <p>

            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="neighbors">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="neighbors">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>

            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="neighbors">Oh dear, that’s too <a class="bad" target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bad" title="What is bad?">bad</a>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="neighbors">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>

            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <a class="good" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/good" target="_blank" title="What is good?">good</a> or <a class="bad" target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bad" title="What is bad?">bad</a> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <a class="good" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/good" target="_blank" title="What is good?">good</a> fortune. </p>
